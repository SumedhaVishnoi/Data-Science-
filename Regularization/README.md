sometimes data becomes overfit 
overfitting means model has low error on training data but high error on test data 
it controls overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function 

1. L1 Regularization 
adds the absolute value of coefficients as penalty 

2. L2 Regularization 
adds the square of coefficients as penalty 

3. elastic net regualrization 
combines 1 and 2
